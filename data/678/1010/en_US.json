			"long_solution": "The patcher encountered an error when applying the patched files to your system. Files on your NAND have been modified and your system is in an unknown state, though there should be no risk of bricking.\n\n<div class=\"tip\">\n⚠️ <b>Do not reboot your console</b>, return to the Wii U Menu or open the Miiverse applet. If you're uncomfortable diagnosing the issue yourself, reach out on our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pretendo\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a>.\n</div>\n\nIf you know what `udplogserver` is, start it now and save the output. Press HOME to exit the Martini patcher, then immediately open it again. If you see an error code, view its [documentation page](/docs/search), but remember not to reboot your console until the system is in a known state again. If, instead, you progress to the confirmation page, and you have the option to uninstall patches by pressing X, you may do so. If you are not given the option to uninstall any patches, reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pretendo), and include a photo of the confirmation screen.",
